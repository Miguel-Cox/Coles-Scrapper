## Core Components

- [ColesProductScraper](#colesproductscraper)
- [ColesPageFetcher](#colespagefetcher)

### ColesProductTileScraper

For extracting product data from category browsing pages, with URLs like `https://www.coles.com.au/browse/<category>` or `https://www.coles.com.au/browse/<category>?page=<page_number>`

Examples:

- `https://www.coles.com.au/browse/fruit-vegetables`
- `https://www.coles.com.au/browse/pantry?page=2`
- `https://www.coles.com.au/browse/dairy-eggs-fridge?page=4`

#### Supported categories include:

- `fruit-vegetables`
- `dairy-eggs-fridge`
- `pantry`
- `meat-seafood`
- `bakery`
- `frozen`
- `household`
- `health-beauty`
- `deli`
- `pet`
- `baby`
- `liquor`

Usage example:

```python
from src.scrapers import ColesProductTileScraper

# Obtain HTML content via your preferred method
html_content = ...

# Create scraper instance and extract products
scraper = ColesProductTileScraper(html_content)
products = scraper.get_all_products()

# Each product contains fields like name, url, price, etc.
for product in products:
    print(product.dict())
```

Example output:

```json
{
  "name": "Coles Bananas | approx 170g",
  "url": "/product/coles-bananas-approx.-170g-409499",
  "price": "$0.68",
  "price_calc_method": "$4.00 per 1kg",
  "image_url": "/next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fproductimages.coles.com.au%2F409499.jpg&w=640&q=90"
}
```

### ColesProductScraper

For extracting detailed information from product pages, with URLs like `https://www.coles.com.au/product/<product-id>`

Examples:

- `https://www.coles.com.au/product/appy-fizz-250ml-8060378`
- `https://www.coles.com.au/product/coles-bananas-approx-170g-409499`

Usage example:

```python
from src.scrapers import ColesProductScraper

# Obtain HTML content for a product page
html_content = ...

# Create scraper instance and get product details
scraper = ColesProductScraper(html_content)
product = scraper.get_product()

print(product.dict())
```

}
```

### ColesPageFetcher

For managing requests with automatic cookie refresh and bot detection handling:

```python
from src.fetcher import ColesPageFetcher

# Initialize fetcher with optional custom headers
fetcher = ColesPageFetcher()

# Fetch pages with automatic cookie management
browse_response = fetcher.get("https://www.coles.com.au/browse/fruit-vegetables")
product_response = fetcher.get("https://www.coles.com.au/product/appy-fizz-250ml-8060378")
```

## Scripts

The project includes several utility scripts in the `scripts/` directory:

- [`scrape_products.py`](scripts/scrape_products.py): Script to scrape all products from specified categories.
- [`scrape_categories.py`](scripts/scrape_categories.py): Script to scrape available product categories.
- [`save_product_page_html.py`](scripts/save_product_page_html.py): Script to save individual product page HTML content.
